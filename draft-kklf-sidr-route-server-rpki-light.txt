     Signaling RPKI Validation Results from a Route-Server to Peers
               draft-kklf-sidr-route-server-rpki-light-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new, non-transitive BGP extended community to
   signal RPKI validation results from a route-server to its peers.
   Upon reception of RPKI validation results peers can use this
   information in their local routing decision process.

   upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed case as English

1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based [RFC6480] route origin validation can be a significant
   operational burden for BGP peers to implement and adopt. In order to 
   boost acceptance and usage of RPKI and ultimately increase the security 
   of the Internet routing system, IXPs may provide RPKI-based route 
   origin validation at the route-server [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server].  
   The result of this route origin validation is signaled to peers by 
   using a BGP extended community introduced in this document.

   Peers receiving the route origin validation result from the route-
   server(s) can use this information in their local routing decision
   process for acceptance, rejection, preference, or other traffic
   engineering purposes of a particular route.

2.  Extended Community for Signaling RPKI Validation Results from a
    Route-Server to Peers

   The extended community for signaling RPKI validation result from a
   route-server to peers is an opaque extended community (see section
   3.3 [RFC4360]) with the following structure:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       0x43    |      0x02     |             Reserved          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    Reserved                   |Validation res.|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The value of the high-order octet of the extended type is set to 0x43
   in order to reflect the non-transitive nature.  The low-order octet
   of the extended type is set to 0x02.  The reserved field MUST be set
   to 0 and ignored upon reception.

   [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling] proposes an encoding of
   the RPKI validation result [RFC6811] as follows:

                           +-------+-----------+
                           | Value | Meaning   |
                           +-------+-----------+
                           |   0   | Valid     |
                           |   1   | Not found |
                           |   2   | Invalid   |
                           +-------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

   This encoding is re-used and stored in the last octet of the extended
   community.

3.  Operational Recommendations

3.1.  Local Routing Decision Process

   A peer receiving an RPKI validation result from the route server MAY
   use the information in its own local routing decision process.  The
   local routing decision process SHOULD apply to the rules as described
   in section 5 [RFC6811].

   A peer receiving an RPKI validation result from the route server MAY
   redistribute this information within its own AS.

3.2.  Route-Server Receiving the Extended Community for RPKI Validation
      Results from a Route-Server to Peers

   An IXP route-server receiving routes from its peers containing the
   extended community described in this document MUST remove the
   extended community before the route is re-distributed to its peers.
   This is required regardless of whether the route-server is executing RPKI
   origin validation or not.

   Failure to do so would allow opportunistic peers to advertise routes
   tagged with arbitrary RPKI validation results via a route-server,
   influencing maliciously the decision process of other route-server
   peers. 
   
3.3.  Error Handling at Peers

   A route sent by a route-server SHOULD only contain none or one
   extended community as described in this document.

   A peer receiving a route from a route-server containing more than one
   extended community as described in this document should only consider
   the largest value (as described in Table 1) in the validation result
   field and disregard the other values.  Values larger than two in the
   validation result field MUST be disregarded.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register the value 0x02 for the low-order
   octet of the extended type in the non-transitive range for the
   concept described in this document.

   The extended community should be called "Route-server RPKI validation
   result extended community".

5.  Security Considerations

   A route-server could be misused to spread malicious RPKI validation
   results.  However, peers have to trust the route-server anyway as it
   collects and redistributes BGP routing information to other peers.

   The introduction of a mechanisms described in this document does not
   pose a new class of attack vectors to the relationship between route-
   servers and peers.
