Signaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from a Route Server to Peers
             draft-ietf-sidrops-route-server-rpki-light-02

Abstract

   This document defines a new BGP opaque extended community, as well
   as its usage, to signal prefix origin validation results from a 
   route server to its peers.  Upon reception of prefix origin 
   validation results, peers can use this information in their 
   local routing decision process.

1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based prefix origin validation [RFC6480] can be a significant
   operational burden for BGP peers to implement and adopt.  In order to
   boost acceptance and usage of prefix origin validation and ultimately
   increase the security of the Internet routing system, IXPs may
   provide RPKI-based prefix origin validation at the route server
   [RFC7947].  The result of this prefix origin validation is signaled
   to peers by using the EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State
   Extended Community as introduced in this document.

   Peers receiving the prefix origin validation result from the route
   server(s) can use this information in their local routing decision

   process for acceptance, rejection, preference, or other traffic
   engineering purposes of a particular route.

2.  EBGP Prefix Origin Validation Extended Community

    The origin validation state extended community is an opaque extended
   community [RFC4360] with the following encoding:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |       0x03    |      TBD1     |             Reserved          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                    Reserved                   |validationstate|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The value of the high-order octet of the extended Type field is 0x03,
   which indicates it is transitive.  The value of the low-order
   octet of the extended Type field as assigned by IANA is TBD1.  The
   Reserved field MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon the receipt of this
   community.  The last octet of the extended community is an unsigned
   integer that gives the route's validation state [RFC6811].  It can
   assume the following values:

                     +-------+-----------------------------+
                     | Value | Meaning                     |
                     +-------+-----------------------------+
                     |   0   | Lookup result = "valid"     |
                     |   1   | Lookup result = "not found" |
                     |   2   | Lookup result = "invalid"   |
                     +-------+-----------------------------+

   If the route server is configured to support the extensions defined in 
   this document, it SHOULD attach the origin validation state extended
   community to BGP UPDATE messages sent to EBGP peers by mapping the
   computed validation state in the last octet of the extended

   community.  Similarly, a receiving BGP speaker, in the absence of
   validation state set based on local data, SHOULD derive a validation
   state from the last octet of the extended community, if present.

   An implementation SHOULD NOT send more than one instance of the
   origin validation state extended community.  However, if more than
   one instance is received, an implementation MUST disregard all
   instances other than the one with the numerically greatest validation
   state value.  If the value received is greater than the largest
   specified value (2), the implementation MUST apply a strategy similar
   to attribute discard [RFC7606] by discarding the erroneous community
   and logging the error for further analysis.

3.  BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Utilized at Route-Servers

   A route server that is aware of a BGP Prefix Origin Validation state
   for a certain route can handle this information in one of the
   following modes of operation:

   Simple Tagging:  The prefix origin validation state is tagged to the
       route as described in Section 2.
       
       This mode of operation is like the traditional way route servers
       work, however, the prefix origin validation state information is
       additionally available for peers.

   Dropping and Tagging:  Routes for which the prefix origin validation
       state is "invalid" (according to [RFC6811]) are dropped by the
       route server.  Routes which show a prefix origin validation state
       of "not found" and "valid" (according to [RFC6811]) are tagged
       accordingly, as discussed in Section 2.
       
       In this mode of operation, security is rated higher than 
       questionable reachability of a prefix.
 
   Prioritizing and Tagging:  If the route server learned for a
       particular prefix more than one route it removes firstly the set
       of "invalid" routes and secondly the "not found" routes unless
       the set of routes is empty.  Based on the set of routes left over
       the BGP best path section algorithm is executed.  The selected
       route is marked accordingly to Section 2.
       The BGP best path selection algorithm is changed by this mode of
       operation in such a way that "valid" routes are preferred even if
       they are unfavorable by the traditional best path selection
       algorithm.  This puts prefix origin validation on top of the best
       path selection.

   A route server MUST support the Simple Tagging mode of operation.
   Other modes of operation are OPTIONAL. The mode of operation MAY be
   configured by the route server operator for a route server instance
   or for each BGP session with a peer separately.

   Path hiding, as originally discussed in [RFC7947], may impact 
   end-to-end connectivity for peers receiving prefixes via route servers
   if the best path selected contains a prefix with an "invalid" prefix
   origin validation state, and subsequently dropped, either at the
   peer (Simple Tagging operation mode) or the route server itself
   (Dropping and Tagging operation mode).

   However, these modes of operation might be used in combination with 
   [RFC7911] in order to allow a peer to receive all routes and take the 
   routing decision by itself.

4.  Signaling Prefix Origin Validation Results from a Route Server to
    Peers

   The EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Community is utilized for 
   signaling prefix origin validation result from a route server to peers.

   This draft  proposes an encoding of the prefix origin validation result
   [RFC6811] as follows:

                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  | Value | Meaning                     |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+
                  |   0   | Lookup result = "valid"     |
                  |   1   | Lookup result = "not found" |
                  |   2   | Lookup result = "invalid"   |
                  +-------+-----------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   This encoding is re-used.  Route servers providing RPKI-based prefix
   origin validation set the validation state according to the prefix
   origin validation result (see [RFC6811]).

5.  Operational Recommendations

5.1.  Local Routing Decision Process

   A peer receiving prefix origin validation results from the route
   server MAY use the information in its own local routing decision
   process. The local routing decision process SHOULD apply to the
   rules as described in section 5 [RFC6811].

   A peer receiving a prefix origin validation result from the route
   server MAY redistribute this information within its own AS.
   
   In cases where multiple ASes are being administered by the same
   authority, peers MAY also redistribute this information across
   EBGP boundaries of the authority in question.  

5.2.  Route Server Receiving the EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State
      Extended Community

   An IXP route server receiving routes from its peers containing the
   EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community MUST remove the
   extended community before the route is re-distributed to its peers.
   This is required regardless of whether the route server is executing
   prefix origin validation or not.

   Failure to do so would allow opportunistic peers to advertise routes
   tagged with arbitrary prefix origin validation results via a route

   server, influencing maliciously the decision process of other route
   server peers.

5.3.  Information about Validity of a BGP Prefix Origin Not Available at
      a Route-Server

   In case information about the validity of a BGP prefix origin is not
   available at the route server (e.g., error in the ROA cache, CPU
   overload) the route server MUST NOT add the EBGP Prefix Origin
   Validation State Extended Community to the route.

5.4.  Error Handling at Peers

   A route sent by a route server SHOULD only contain none or one EBGP
   Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community.

   A peer receiving a route from a route server containing more than one
   EBGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community SHOULD only
   consider the largest value (as described in Table 1) in the
   validation result field and disregard the other values.  Values
   larger than two in the validation result field MUST be disregarded.

6.  IANA Considerations

    IANA is asked to assign a Transitive BGP Opaque Extended Community
    as well as a Transitive Opaque Extended Community Sub-Type for
    the purposes of this draft, as defined in Section 4. of RFC 7153.

7.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations described in RFC 6811 [RFC6811] fully
   apply to this document.

   Additionally, threat agents polluting ROA cache server(s) run by IXP
   operators could cause significant operational impact, since multiple
   route server clients could be affected.  Peers should be vigilant as
   to the integrity and authenticity of the origin validation results,
   as they are provided by a third party, namely the IXP operator
   hosting both the route server as well as any ROA cache server(s).

   Therefore, a route server could be misused to spread malicious prefix
   origin validation results.  However, peers already trust the route
   server for the collection, filtering (e.g.  IRR database filtering),
   and redistribution of BGP routing information to other peers.  So, no
   change in the trust level is needed for this proposal.

   To facilitate trust and help with peers establishing appropriate
   controls in mitigating the risks mentioned above, IXPs SHOULD provide
   out-of-band means for peers to ensure that the ROA validation process
   has not been compromised or corrupted.

   While beeing under DDoS attacks, it is a common practice for peers
   connected to an IXP to make use of blackholing services (see
   [RFC7999]).  Peers are using blackholing to drop traffic, typically
   by announcing a more specific prefix, which is under attack.  A peer
   SHOULD make sure that this prefix is covered by an appropriate ROA.
